# Face Recognition Attendance System

This repository contains a Machine Learning-based **Face Recognition Attendance System** built with Python. It enables automated attendance tracking using facial recognition.

## Research
This project is based on research published in IAEME:

- **Title**: *ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USING FACE
RECOGNITION AND RASPBERRY PI â€“ REVIEW*  
- **Authors**: Ansari Mohammed Sajjad  
- **Journal/Conference**: IAEME  
- **Publication Date**: 2023-04-03  
- **Abstract**: The current attendance procedure is manual. Both professors and students lose a
lot of time as a result. Wait times for students increase when attendance is manually
recorded. Human mistake is closely linked to manual labor. Every person's face serves
as important, recognizable proof. Therefore, automating the attendance procedure will
increase learning time in the classroom. To make facial recognition accessible to
everyone, we picked the Raspberry Pi. A Raspberry Pi-based facial recognition system
using traditional facial recognition and recognition mechanisms is provided. For
security and surveillance purposes, facial recognition is crucial. Therefore, a system
that is effective and affordable is needed. Face recognition is the foundation of the
identification process, which is then broken down into the following three steps: face
recognition, feature extraction and classification, and real-time detection. It is
acknowledged that facial recognition is a crucial stage in our system. This system is
implemented in Python using the OpenCV library.
